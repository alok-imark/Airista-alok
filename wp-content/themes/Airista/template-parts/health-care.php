                    <h2>WHOLE HOSPITAL VISIBILTY</h2>

                    <p>Real-time location systems (RTLS) such as AiRISTA Flow’s solutions provide visibility into the location, status, and movement of equipment, personnel, and patients enterprise-wide. The data from an AiRISTA Flow RTLS solution can provide a rich warehouse of information that can be mined and used to improve hospitals’ business processes and enhance their resource utilization. Reaching these objectives in a healthcare environment demands that the RTLS technologies deployed promote co-existence with other hospital infrastructure technologies. This includes the growing variety of network-enabled and wireless medical equipment found in doctors’ offices, ERs, whole hospitals, and even multi-building medical campuses. With AiRISTA Flow, RTLS solutions are quickly and inexpensively deployed to scale without patient care disruption.
