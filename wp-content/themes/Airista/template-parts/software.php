                        <h6>Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) Location Engine</h6>
                        <p> AiRISTA Flow’s RSSI Location Engine is suitable for usage indoors, makes use of the existing Wi-Fi infrastructure and relies on the measurement of signal strength to determine location of tagged assets and staff based on patented technologies. RSSI Solutions begin with an RS fingerprint – a map of the strength of the radio signals at various points. When a radio frequency (RF) signal is introduced into that environment, RF access points read the strength of the signal. The system then compares that to the archived RS fingerprint to determine a location using mathematical algorithms. RSSI solutions work for both indoor and outdoor environments to provide a comprehensive positioning system.  </p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li>With AiRISTA’s Wi-Fi RTLS tags, existing WLAN infrastructure can be utilized</li>
                            <li>Accuracy levels provided by AiRISTA Flow’s RSSI Engine provide effective solutions for application demanding real-time location tracking indoors</li>
                            <li>Sensors may be incorporated into various types of tags to gain information about the environment and status of the tagged individuals or assets</li>
                            <li>Addition of the optional RTLS Business Rules allow for enforcing inclusion/exclusion and dynamic zones and schedule based tracking</li>
                            <li>Additional option Track & Trace feature for playback on captured historical data empower users to optimize business processes, increase asset utilization and increase personnel safety </li>

                        <h4>GPS Location Engine</h4>
                       
                        <p> Suitable for outdoor usage, relies on latitude and longitude coordinates acquired from satellites to determine location of tagged assets and personnel. Devices may use Wi-Fi or a cellular network to transmit information for processing.  AiRISTA Flow or third-party GPS hardware devices may use Wi-Fi, Cellular and or Data Communication Satellite networks to transmit information to AiRISTA Flow’s UVS Server. Our GPS location engine can deployed autonomously or in concert with many of AiRISTA Flow’s other platforms, in order to provide seamless track and trace capability both indoors and outdoors. </p>
